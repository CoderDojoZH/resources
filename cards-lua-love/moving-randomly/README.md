# Moving randomly

Move in a random direction and bounce at the edges.

## Todo

- top and left should check against 0 and not size.
- it is probably necessary to first calculate the new coordinates and only apply them if it does not overflow.
- we could probably also use a min / max to make sure that it does not overflow. (probably not)
