# Your first steps with pygame

- [Start a pygame project with Thonny](project-thonny) (or [Start a pygame project in a Linux / MacOs terminal](project-terminal))
- [Starting with pygame](pygame-start)
- [Creating a Game class](game-class)
- [Your first sprite / actor](first-sprite)
- [Events: move your sprite](events-sprite)

To be written:

- [Continous movements](continous-movement) (TBW)
- [Jump](jump) (TBW)

As a reference, this is a typical pygame loop, without a `Game` class:

- [Create a game loop for pygame](game-loop)

## Todo

- Split creating a Game class in smalle chunks
- Is it a good idea to put the events detection in the sprites?  
  It might be better to keep it in `Game` and apply changes to specific sprites.
- Actors or sprites?
