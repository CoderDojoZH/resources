# Moving on a grid

This tutorial contains a Grid class for PyGame Zero:

- A grid defined as a list of strings, where each character defines the content of the cell.
- Helper functions to move around the inside of the grid.
- Helper functions to convert the cells into coordinates.

The Block class:

- static obstacles

The Chicken class:

- An actor that moves around on the grid by "continous" movements (once the direction is set it's kept until an event happens).
- Stops when hitting the blocks.
