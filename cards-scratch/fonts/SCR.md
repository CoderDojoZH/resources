# The Scratch Font

<http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_Font> is an old font by [Jakob Fischer](http://pizzadude.dk). It might have been modified by the Scratch project.

The [SCR.TTF font](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_Font) has been downloaded from the Scratch Website.

The original license conditions referenced in the metadata state that the font is free to be downloaded and distributed. Mr. Fischer is currently distributing the same font as free for personal use only.
