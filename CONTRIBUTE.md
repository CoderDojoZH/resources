## Translations

If you want to help out, do a translation (and don't know how github works) just download

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoderDojoZH/resources/master/cards/cards.md

translate its content and

- add the translated file in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CoderDojoZH/resources/issues).
- send the translated file to the coderdojozh mailing list.

If you know how github works, you can also fork, branch, create a new file like cards-deCH.md, translate and make a pull request.

## Creating new cards

We plan to create new cards, with two or four A6 pages. Get in touch with us with you have ideas to share!
