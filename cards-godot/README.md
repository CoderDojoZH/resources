  - Lot of small very specific tutorials
  - TheScythe2112 says: But some of these tutorials/courses had huge flaws, that severely hampered information retention:
    1. Assignments were too easy:  
       Sometimes in order to complete an assignment you simply had to rename a variable or copy mindlessly the syntax that was given as an example. This is not good teaching. To learn something as a student I need to be forced to understand the properties of the question and at best rearrange these to fit the given problem. Often this problem seemed to stem from not wanting to leave anyone behind. But making everything modular and "jump in at any point"-feasible hamstrings the construction of a good and engaging difficulty/learning curve.
    2. Code created was hard to reference back to:  
       What I mean by that: After completing a course I would sometimes face a problem in "the real world" that was very similar to an assignment I had done. But In order to get the information out I needed to restart the course, click through all the steps before to look at the solution of the assignment. This could have been solved in a variety of ways. Either writing good cheat sheets that the student gets at the end of the course or have a method in place to download your finished code for future reference. Or have a good indexing system for completed task that makes it easy to navigate back to finished parts.
    3. Code test were to obscure or wrong:  
       By wrong I mean the test sometimes marked a task as not completed when all that was missing was a blank space in front of or after e.g., a variable name. That is a killer for any enthusiasm if one is not very self-driven or curious - and new to coding. Searching an hour for an error that is no error, but simply different formatting is very frustrating and could turn away some students. One of the online courses I use has a tool in place now that enables "diffing" what you coded with the solution of the instructor, similar to git. This helps a lot to see if you are only missing a white space or if something else is wrong with your code, but this also makes it easier to "cheat" by looking at the solution. But let’s be honest, cheating cannot be completely avoided. And I feel having good hints or tools in place to self-check is more important than making cheating impossible - especially if you do not plan to give out certificates, like some websites do.

## Notes

- A huge tip if you're moving to godot:
  Go to the settings>text editor>behavior, and turn off the "Open dominant script on scene change." There's a similar option under the settings>text editor>files menu, DO NOT BE TRICKED.
There's also a few other goodies like scrolling past the end of the file.
