## Internal

### The Zurich CoderDojo

The Zurich CoderDojo is a multilingual group (DE, EN, IT, PL, FR).  
You will learn much more out of this sesions if you can attend regularly. Of course it does not have to be every week.  Bring your own laptop. If needed, we can also provide computers on demand.  No constant supervision by parents is necessary. Parents can relax in our small lounge.

### Activities

Ninjas who have never been coding before, are introduced to Lightbot and learn the basics about programming.  
Our main platform is Scratch, a powerful jigsaw-like programming environment.  
On top of it we run MaKey MaKey, Thymio and other interesting workshops.

###Get in touch

You can get in touch with the Zurich CoderDojo and follow our news through our Twitter channel:

### Lightbot

Lightbot is an educational game that introduces several principles of programming like sequence, conditions, and loops. Kids use their problem solving skills to complete the puzzles!

### Thymio

Thymio II is an affordable educational robot providing a large number of sensors and actuators, allowing interactions based on light and touch, with graphical and text programming.

### Scratch

Scratch is a free educational programming language that was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with over 5 million registered users.

Scratch is designed to be fun, educational, and easy to learn. It has the tools for creating interactive stories, games, art, simulations, and more. Scratch has its own paint editor, a sound editor and a ton of pre-made assets that make it easy to pick up via example.

Scratch makes coding accessible by providing blocks like a jigsaw puzzle that you drag and combine into structures.

It’s a powerful and simple tool that allows you to just try things out and see what happens.

### Makey Makey
    
MaKey MaKey works like a keyboard but does not look at like one: it's a colorful octopus with lot of cables and alligators clip connecting objects from your everyday life to your games. Or your Scratch programs. It works with bananas, play-doh and all conductive materials!

### Testimonial

"Kids come in expecting to be able to make Minecraft.  
After spending about 30 minutes showing them just how to make a fish and a cat collide and behave properly, they would all gain a new appreciation of just what went into making a game work.  
After that, every kid would have all sorts of ideas of what to do to make the game their own."  
Adriel Wallick, games programmer.
