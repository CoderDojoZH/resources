New coders are welcome to explore different coding programs and games.

Regulars are welcome to carry on with projects and programs that they started on, or try something different.

Remember: It is the children's Dojo; they decide what they want to do and learn and mentors are there to support them to have fun doing that.

Everyone, including the accompanying parents, should bring:

• A snack and drink

• A working laptop with a keyboard they can 'read' (i.e. the keys correspond to what appears on screen) and preferably a mouse that they can operate.

Children 12 years and under should be accompanied by a parent or other enthusiastic adult (who is also encouraged to bring his or her laptop and play & program, too.)

If you don't have a laptop, we can organize one for the CoderDojo duration. Please contact us at least a week earlier, so we can prepare.

We speak all the languages, so feel free to join;)
