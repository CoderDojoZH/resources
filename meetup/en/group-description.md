Programming workshops for young minds, 7-17 years old. You can learn more about us from our page at: http://coderdojozh.github.io . We are part of the CoderDojo network ( http://coderdojo.com/about ).

Young coders will experiment with various coding programs, learn from others, and share what they know with whoever is interested. The only rule is "To Be Cool!"

These workshops are free: Mentoring coders give up part of their Sunday, because they're passionate about their work and want to give interested children the chance to play around, and create games and apps.

Your child should bring a laptop, snack & drink, and a parent or other adult if they're 12 years old or under. Plus heaps of stamina and curiosity.

Please make sure that the laptop has a key board the child will be able to read, and a mouse it can operate. A mouse usually works better than a trackpad.

We recommend that accompanying parents bring their own laptop along, as well. You may help settle in your child for the first half hour. After that we will ask you to sit at a dedicated table for parents and try out the various programs for yourself.

This way you will be able to help other children if the mentors can't keep up with the demand for explanations and it will give your own child plenty of space to get independently creative.

Though aimed at ages 7-17, this site is really for parents, mentors and others over the age of 18 to help us with events and to see how many people to expect at events. If you are under the age of 18, you may not sign up on this site or RSVP for events. Instead, ask your parent or 18+ guardian to do so for you. If you're 12 years or younger, your parent or 18+ guardian will have to accompany you during the workshops. This is in accordance with Meetup and CoderDojo policies.
