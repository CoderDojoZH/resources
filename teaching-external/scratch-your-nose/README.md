1. Creating a sprite

   - Go to costumes
   - Draw with circles, lines and rectangles
   - Set fill and line color
   - Clone and move items
   - Choose a backdrop
   - Add the `xy-grid` backgrop from the library

2. Moving using keys

  - show motion
  - show `the on key pressed` control element
  - right: `on right key + move 10
  - left: `on left key + move -10`
  - left: `point in direction 0 > move 10 ; right: point in direction 90 > move 10; up: point in direction 0 > move 10; down point in direction 180 > move 10`

3. Moving using the mouse

  - `When green flag + got to mouse pointer`
  - Follow: `When green flag + forever + got to mouse pointer`
  - Add a delay: `When green flag + forever (wait 1 second + got to mouse pointer)`
  - Point to mouse: `When green flag + forever (wait 1 second + point towards mouse pointer + got to mouse pointer)`

4. Sprite interaction

  - Starting point: Tutorial 2
  - Add the `xy-grid` backdrop
  - Add the shark (or any scary sprite)
  - Get the shark to move around forever: `forever + move 10 steps`
  - Slow down by putting a `wait of 0.1 seconds` after each move
  - `If on edge bounce`
  - `If on edge bounce + set rotation style left-right`
  - `set rotation 15Â°` before starting the forever loop
  - Add `switch costume` after each move to improve the animation

5. Sprite interaction (2)

  - Starting point: Tutorial 4
  - use `next costume` instead of switching to specific costume
  - move around your sprite to avoid the shark
  - remove the `next costume`
  - at the bottom of the shark's forever loop add a `if touching sprite 1(switch to costume with open mouth)`

6. Adding sounds

  - Starting point: Tutorial 2
  - Go to sprite's sound tab, choose a sound, play it
  - `If touching edge (play sound)`
  - duplicate it three time and add it to each `when key pressed` control

7. Point scoring

  - Starting point: Tutorial 2
  - add a wizard hat sprite
  - create `points` variable and place its visualisation in the top left corner
  - on the same green flag event add a `forever loop + (if touching hat + change points by 1)
  - to avoid huge points count add a `glide to 0, 0` at the end of the loop

8. Instructions

  - Starting point: Tutorial 3
  - Write the instruction on the backgrop: "Use mouse to guide the nose.\n Click on green to start"
  - Add a fancy backdrop
  - On the backdrop add "on green flag > switch backdrop"

11. Adding costumes

 - Download images from Nose pack (or any other website that has PNGs on it)
 - Open the file from Scratch
 - Loading costumes from further PNGs
 - (with a bit of luck, SVGs are also valid costumes and are easier to tweak)

12. Animating costumes

 - Choose a sprite with multiple costumes
 - `When flag clicked + next costume + wait 0.5 sec + next ... `
 - `When flag clicked + forever (next costume + wait 0.5 sec + next ... )`
 - `When loudness + next costume`, put a sound on click on another sprite and click on that sprite

13. Adding game timers

 - Make a `timer" variable for the current sprite only
 - Rename the sprite
 - `When flag clicked + set timer to 60 + wait 1 secs + change timer by 1`
 - `When flag clicked + repeat 60 (set timer to 60 + wait 1 secs + change timer by 1)` fails
 - `When flag clicked + set timer to 60 +  repeat 60 (wait 1 secs + change timer by 1)`
 - clone the sprite: each one has its own timer

14. Cloning a sprite

 - download the robot from the dancethon "scratch your nose" pack (or use any other dancing sprite)
 - `when this sprite clicked + create clone of [sprite name]`
 - `when this sprite clicked + create clone of [sprite name]` + `when i start as a clone + move 100 steps + change ghost effect by 50`; move around the original with mouse and create ghost clones
 - `when this sprite clicked + create clone of [sprite name]` + `when i start as a clone + repeat 2 times (wait 1 secs +move 100 steps + change ghost effect by 50)`
 - `when this sprite clicked + create clone of [sprite name]` + `when i start as a clone + repeat 2 times (wait 1 secs +move 100 steps + change ghost effect by 50) + delete clone`

15. Following a line

 - `when space key pressed + set size to 50% + glide 1 secs to -200,-100` (set the size to something meaningful)
 - `when this sprite clicked + forever (move 10 steps + wait 0.2 secs + next costume)`
 - add a sprite with a diagonal line in the right lower corner, move the original sprite with the mouse and show it following it. 
 - at the end of the loop of the `when this sprite clicked` event add `if touching sprite [line] then + change y by 10 + change size by -3`
 - add a background with a path that matches the line by form and color (like the purple chastle hall): the sprite follows the carpet and shrinks while getting more far away.
